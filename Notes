I found a couple of problems here first of all
you should not use variables from the exterior
so you cannot use the 'users' array in the controller
because the global users symbols can be modified by other functions in other parts of your program
if you want access to the users object from inside the MinorDetector object, you must get it through this.get('users')

always decalre your variables with var
so in your for loop
var i = ...

the dependency should be users.@each.birthdate instead of user.@each.birthdate

also I noticed you haven't changed the controller type
and deleted the content property
I thought it should be ObjectController?
does your route have a model?
oh
no it doesn't
is that the mystream route or login route?

the login controller, so it should be the login route..
so the login route has no model, then the controller should not be objectcontroller
ok, so it doesn't work because

sorry so should the login route have a model then?
your application doesn't have an adapter configured
if you check your javascript console
it's trying to make a query to a remote server
so you haven't configured the fixtureadapter
