I found a couple of problems here first of all
you should not use variables from the exterior
so you cannot use the 'users' array in the controller
because the global users symbols can be modified by other functions in other parts of your program
if you want access to the users object from inside the MinorDetector object, you must get it through this.get('users')

always decalre your variables with var
so in your for loop
var i = ...

the dependency should be users.@each.birthdate instead of user.@each.birthdate

also I noticed you haven't changed the controller type
and deleted the content property
I thought it should be ObjectController?
does your route have a model?
oh
no it doesn't
is that the mystream route or login route?

the login controller, so it should be the login route..
so the login route has no model, then the controller should not be objectcontroller
ok, so it doesn't work because

sorry so should the login route have a model then?
your application doesn't have an adapter configured
if you check your javascript console
it's trying to make a query to a remote server
so you haven't configured the fixtureadapter

and then a model for the route?
why do you need a model for the route?
if you use the fixture adapter then you don't need one?
it has nothing to do with what adapter you use. the route has a model only if it needs to fetch some data to display on the screen
on the login page theres no data to display so you don't need a model

oh thanks I get that now. You're still fetching data for the username and password though, which is where I was getting confused
yeah but you do that in the action, where you need it


questions 10/9 :


create separate view for posts and render within my-stream template to save duplication ? or use partial ? Use component

How to create reply and render publish within post?m Components

post template - handlebars not applying margin on p?


2.	You should not be able to delete posts of other users than yourself, nor should you see the delete button on their posts. Define delete component

3.	Format the timestamps of each post properly. Use moment.js Done

4.	When I go to URL / and I am logged in, redirect me to my stream.

5.	The user profile pages aren’t fully implemented yet.
