I found a couple of problems here
first of all
you should not use variables from the exterior
so you cannot use the 'users' array in the controller
because the global users symbols can be modified by other functions in other parts of your program
if you want access to the users object from inside the MinorDetector object, you must get it through this.get('users')

always decalre your variables with var
so in your for loop
var i = ...

the dependency should be users.@each.birthdate instead of user.@each.birthdate

does your route have a model?
Andrei • 15 mins
oh
no it doesn't
is that the mystream route or login route?

the login controller, so it should be the login route..
so the login route has no model, then the controller should not be objectcontroller
ok, so it doesn't work because
Andrei • 12 mins
sorry so should the login route have a model then?

your application doesn't have an adapter configured
if you check your javascript console
Andrei • 11 mins
oh right
11 mins
Steve Tyler
Andrei Soare
it's trying to make a query to a remote server
so you haven't configured the fixtureadapter
Andrei • 11 mins
so I need to do that then?
yes I do
10 mins
Steve Tyler
Andrei Soare
yes
Andrei • 9 mins
and then a model for the route?
9 mins
Steve Tyler
Andrei Soare
why do you need a model for the route?
Andrei • 8 mins
if you use the fixture adapter then you don't need one?
7 mins
Steve Tyler
Andrei Soare
it has nothing to do with what adapter you use. the route has a model only if it needs to fetch some data to display on the screen
on the login page theres no data to display so you don't need a model
Andrei • 6 mins
oh thanks I get that now. You're still fetching data for the username and password though, which is where I was getting confused
4 mins
Steve Tyler
Andrei Soare
yeah but you do that in the action, where you need it
Andrei • 4 mins
ok cool thanks.
